<h3>About Me</h3>
<h6>I am an active learner passionate about becoming a web application security engineer. With a solid foundation in cybersecurity and hands-on experience in web application penetration testing, I continuously seek to expand my knowledge through professional development, self-education, and participation in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. My goal is to apply my expertise in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, using tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Python scripting, to enhance the security of web applications. I am committed to contributing effectively to a dynamic organization by staying updated on the latest security threats and continuously improving my skills.</h6>
